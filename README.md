# DH307-Pipeline

The above folder contains the pipeline for RNA-sequence Analysis for single-end sequencing which is similar to the paired-end sequencing pipeline.
But I want to know whether the above pipeline is correct or not? or what extra changes I have to made in the pipeline for the single-end sequencing? or what extra steps I need to add in the pipeline to make it complete for single-end sequencing pipeline?
